# Nostr Banger Repost Bot

A Node.js bot for the Nostr protocol that schedules reposts of "banger" posts at user-specified intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). Mention the bot in a reply with a command like "banger weekly for 3 weeks" or "repeat 3 times daily," and it will schedule up to 3 reposts, quoting the full original event with varied, user-attributed messages like "This banger was brought to you by @npub...! ðŸ”¥". Built with `nostr-tools`.

## Features
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` intervals with any duration (e.g., "hourly for 3 days" schedules 3 reposts over 72 hours) or literal repetitions (e.g., "3 times weekly").
- **Exact Timing**: Reposts occur at precise intervals (e.g., every week at the same time). Missed tasks (due to downtime) are executed immediately on restart.
- **Proper Quoting**: Uses kind 6 repost events (NIP-18) to quote the full original post, including metadata (author, timestamp, etc.), displayed correctly in Nostr clients.
- **Varied Reposts**: Randomly selects fun messages, crediting the requester (e.g., "Shoutout to @npub... for unearthing this gem! ðŸ’Ž").
- **Task Limits**: Only one active schedule per post; new schedules wait with a reply: "There's already a task running for this post. Wait until it completes!"
- **Scalable Persistence**: Stores tasks in `tasks.json` (capped at 10,000 tasks) for reliable scheduling across restarts.
- **Nostr Integration**: Uses `nostr-tools` to listen for mentions and publish reposts across multiple reliable relays.
- **Downtime Handling**: Executes missed reposts immediately on startup, then continues the schedule.

## Usage on Nostr
1. Reply to a post you want reposted, tagging the botâ€™s public key (get the `npub` from the botâ€™s profile or logs).
2. Include a command in your reply, like:
   - `banger hourly for 3 hours` (3 reposts, exactly 1h apart)
   - `repeat daily for 2 weeks` (3 reposts, exactly 1d apart)
   - `3 times weekly` (3 reposts, exactly 1w apart)
   - `banger yearly for 2 years` (3 reposts, exactly 1y apart)
3. The bot replies to confirm (e.g., "Banger detected! Setting up those reposts (3 reposts over 2 weeks).").
4. If a task is active, it replies: "There's already a task running for this post. Wait until it completes!"
5. Reposts appear as kind 6 events, quoting the full original post with metadata and a message like "This banger was brought to you by @your_npub! ðŸ”¥".
6. If the bot was offline, missed reposts are posted immediately on restart, then continue on schedule.

## Local Setup
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (v16+)
   - Git
   - A Nostr private key (nsec format)
2. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd nostr-banger-bot
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure**:
   - Create `.env` with:
     ```
     PRIVATE_KEY=nsec1yourprivatekeyhere
     ```
   - Get an nsec from a Nostr client (e.g., Damus, Amethyst).
4. **Run**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Test**:
   - Check logs for botâ€™s public key (`npub...`).
   - Reply to a post on Nostr, tag the bot, use a command like "banger weekly for 3 weeks."
   - Verify confirmation and kind 6 reposts (full event quotes) in your Nostr client.
   - Test downtime: Stop bot, wait past a scheduled time, restart, and check for immediate repost.
