Nostr Banger Repost Bot
A simple bot for the Nostr protocol that schedules reposts of "banger" posts at user-specified intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). Mention the bot in a reply with a command like "banger hourly for 3 hours" or "repeat 3 times weekly," and it will schedule up to 3 reposts at exact intervals with varied, user-attributed messages like "This banger was brought to you by @npub...! ðŸ”¥". Built with Node.js and nostr-tools, itâ€™s easy to deploy locally or on Render.com.
Features

Flexible Scheduling: Supports hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly intervals with any duration (e.g., "hourly for 3 days" schedules 3 reposts over 72 hours) or literal repetitions (e.g., "3 times weekly").
Exact Timing: Reposts occur at precise intervals (e.g., every hour on the hour, every day at the same time).
Varied Reposts: Randomly selects fun messages, crediting the requester (e.g., "Blame @npub... for this much heat. ðŸ”¥").
Task Limits: Only one active schedule per post; new schedules wait until the current one completes.
Scalable Persistence: Stores tasks in tasks.json (capped at 10,000 tasks) for reliable scheduling.
Nostr Integration: Uses nostr-tools to listen for mentions and publish reposts across multiple relays.

Usage on Nostr

Reply to a post you want reposted, tagging the botâ€™s public key (get the npub from the botâ€™s profile or logs).
Include a command in your reply, like:
banger hourly for 3 hours (3 reposts, exactly 1h apart)
repeat daily for 2 weeks (3 reposts, exactly 1d apart)
3 times weekly (3 reposts, exactly 1w apart)
banger monthly for 2 years (3 reposts, exactly 1m apart)


The bot replies to confirm (e.g., "Banger detected! Setting up those reposts (3 reposts over 2 weeks).").
If a task is active, it replies: "There's already a task running for this post. Wait until it completes!"
Reposts appear with varied messages, crediting you (e.g., "Shoutout to @your_npub for unearthing this gem! ðŸ’Ž").
