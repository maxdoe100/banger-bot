# Nostr Banger Repost Bot

A Node.js bot for the Nostr protocol that schedules reposts of "banger" posts at user-specified intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). Mention the bot in a reply with a command like "banger weekly for 3 weeks" or "repeat 3 times daily," and it will schedule up to 3 reposts as kind 1 events, quoting the original post via a NIP-21 `nostr:nevent1...` identifier with relay hints, and varied, user-attributed messages like "This banger was brought to you by @npub...! ðŸ”¥". Built with `nostr-tools`.

## Features
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Supports `hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `yearly` intervals with any duration (e.g., "hourly for 3 days" schedules 3 reposts over 72 hours) or literal repetitions (e.g., "3 times weekly").
- **Exact Timing**: Reposts occur at precise intervals (e.g., every week at the same time). Missed tasks (due to downtime) are executed immediately on restart.
- **Proper Quoting**: Uses kind 1 events with NIP-21 `nostr:nevent1...` IDs (via `neventEncode`), including relay hints in `e` and `p` tags and recommended relays in `r` tags, ensuring clients (e.g., Damus, Amethyst) display the full original post with metadata (author, timestamp).
- **Varied Reposts**: Randomly selects fun messages, crediting the requester with `nostr:npub...` (e.g., "Shoutout to @npub... for unearthing this gem! ðŸ’Ž").
- **Task Limits**: Only one active schedule per post; new schedules wait with a reply: "There's already a task running for this post. Wait until it completes!"
- **Scalable Persistence**: Stores tasks in `tasks.json` (capped at 10,000 tasks, ~10-20MB) for reliable scheduling across restarts.
- **Nostr Integration**: Uses `nostr-tools` for event signing, relay management (`SimplePool`), and subscriptions to listen for mentions across multiple reliable relays.
- **Downtime Handling**: Executes missed reposts immediately on startup, then continues the schedule.

## Usage on Nostr
1. Reply to a post you want reposted, tagging the botâ€™s public key (get the `npub` from the botâ€™s profile or logs).
2. Include a command in your reply, like:
   - `banger hourly for 3 hours` (3 reposts, exactly 1h apart)
   - `repeat daily for 2 weeks` (3 reposts, exactly 1d apart)
   - `3 times weekly` (3 reposts, exactly 1w apart)
   - `banger yearly for 2 years` (3 reposts, exactly 1y apart)
3. The bot replies to confirm (e.g., "Banger detected! Setting up those reposts (3 reposts over 2 weeks).").
4. If a task is active, it replies: "There's already a task running for this post. Wait until it completes!"
5. Reposts appear as kind 1 events with a `nostr:nevent1...` ID, showing the full original post (e.g., content, author, timestamp) in clients, with a message like "This banger was brought to you by @npub...! ðŸ”¥".
6. If the bot was offline, missed reposts are posted immediately on restart, then continue on schedule.

## Local Setup
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (v16+)
   - Git
   - A Nostr private key (nsec format, e.g., from Damus or Amethyst)
2. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd nostr-banger-bot
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure**:
   - Create `.env` with:
     ```
     PRIVATE_KEY=nsec1yourprivatekeyhere
     DATA_PATH=./tasks.json
     ```
   - Get an nsec from a Nostr client.
4. **Run**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Test**:
   - Check logs for botâ€™s public key (`npub...`).
   - Reply to a post on Nostr, tag the bot, use a command like "banger weekly for 3 weeks."
   - Verify confirmation and kind 1 reposts with `nostr:nevent1...` in your Nostr client (e.g., Damus), showing the full quoted post.
   - Test downtime: Stop bot, wait past a scheduled time, restart, and check for immediate repost in logs and client.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: `TypeError: neventEncode is not a function`**:
  - Ensure `nostr-tools@^2.7.2` is installed (`npm install nostr-tools@2.7.2`).
  - Check `index.js` imports `neventEncode` from `nostr-tools/nip19`.
- **Missed Tasks Fail**: Confirm `tasks.json` exists and is readable. Test downtime locally by stopping and restarting.
- **No Reposts**: Verify `PRIVATE_KEY` is a valid nsec and relays in `CONFIG.RELAYS` are active (e.g., `wss://relay.damus.io`).
