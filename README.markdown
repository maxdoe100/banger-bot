Nostr Banger Repost Bot
A Node.js bot for the Nostr protocol that schedules reposts of "banger" posts at user-specified intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly). Mention the bot in a reply with a command like "banger weekly for 3 weeks" or "repeat 3 times daily," and it will schedule up to 3 reposts, quoting the full original event with varied, user-attributed messages like "This banger was brought to you by @npub...! ðŸ”¥". Built with nostr-tools, itâ€™s deployable locally or on Render.com.
Features

Flexible Scheduling: Supports hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly intervals with any duration (e.g., "hourly for 3 days" schedules 3 reposts over 72 hours) or literal repetitions (e.g., "3 times weekly").
Exact Timing: Reposts occur at precise intervals (e.g., every week at the same time). Missed tasks (due to downtime) are executed immediately on restart.
Proper Quoting: Uses kind 6 repost events (NIP-18) to quote the full original post, including metadata (author, timestamp, etc.), displayed correctly in Nostr clients.
Varied Reposts: Randomly selects fun messages, crediting the requester (e.g., "Shoutout to @npub... for unearthing this gem! ðŸ’Ž").
Task Limits: Only one active schedule per post; new schedules wait with a reply: "There's already a task running for this post. Wait until it completes!"
Scalable Persistence: Stores tasks in tasks.json (capped at 10,000 tasks) for reliable scheduling across restarts.
Nostr Integration: Uses nostr-tools to listen for mentions and publish reposts across multiple reliable relays.
Downtime Handling: Executes missed reposts immediately on startup, then continues the schedule.

Usage on Nostr

Reply to a post you want reposted, tagging the botâ€™s public key (get the npub from the botâ€™s profile or logs).
Include a command in your reply, like:
banger hourly for 3 hours (3 reposts, exactly 1h apart)
repeat daily for 2 weeks (3 reposts, exactly 1d apart)
3 times weekly (3 reposts, exactly 1w apart)
banger yearly for 2 years (3 reposts, exactly 1y apart)


The bot replies to confirm (e.g., "Banger detected! Setting up those reposts (3 reposts over 2 weeks).").
If a task is active, it replies: "There's already a task running for this post. Wait until it completes!"
Reposts appear as kind 6 events, quoting the full original post with metadata and a message like "This banger was brought to you by @your_npub! ðŸ”¥".
If the bot was offline, missed reposts are posted immediately on restart, then continue on schedule.

Local Setup

Prerequisites:
Node.js (v16+)
Git
A Nostr private key (nsec format)


Clone and Install:git clone <your-repo-url>
cd nostr-banger-bot
npm install


Configure:
Create .env with:PRIVATE_KEY=nsec1yourprivatekeyhere


Get an nsec from a Nostr client (e.g., Damus, Amethyst).


Run:npm start


Test:
Check logs for botâ€™s public key (npub...).
Reply to a post on Nostr, tag the bot, use a command like "banger weekly for 3 weeks."
Verify confirmation and kind 6 reposts (full event quotes) in your Nostr client.
Test downtime: Stop bot, wait past a scheduled time, restart, and check for immediate repost.
